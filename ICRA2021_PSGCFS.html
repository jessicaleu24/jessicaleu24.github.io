<p>Welcome!
This website supplements our ICRA 2021 submission, in which we introduced a fast motion planning algorithm, projected stochastic gradient convex feasible set algorithm for real time motion planning that can handle problems which have convex cost function and non-convex constraints and are often encountered in robot motion planning problems.</p>
<p>With the advancing robotics technology, researchers and engineers are craving for real time motion planning. However, motion planning problems for robots are often highly non-convex due to obstacles in the environment. This situation makes it difficult for most of the existing non-convex optimization algorithms to achieve real time computation. This paper introduces the projected stochastic gradient convex feasible set algorithm (PSGCFS) which is inspired by the original convex feasible set algorithm (CFS). PSGCFS is a fast algorithm for non-convex optimization problems that have convex costs and non-convex constraints. Instead of solving a sequence of subproblems as in CFS and other commonly seen non-convex algorithm, PSGCFS performs projected gradient descent to increase time-efficiency. Stochastic noise term is also introduced during gradient descent so that PSGCFS can better deal with local optimums. The analysis of the convergence rate of PSGCFS is included in the paper. Simulation experiments with mobile robot settings are conducted and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.</p>
